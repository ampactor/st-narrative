    "summary": "Jupiter Aggregator v6 processes an estimated 211,765 tx/hr — roughly 8.5x the throughput of Raydium AMM (25,000 tx/hr) — cementing its position as the default routing layer for Solana DeFi. This matters because aggregator dominance concentrates liquidity discovery into a single protocol, creating a structural dependency where new DEXes must integrate Jupiter to reach users. Combined with 9 new DeFi GitHub repos (269 stars, 229 forks) including DEX parsers and arbitrage bots, the surrounding tooling ecosystem is building specifically around Jupiter's transaction flow.",

However, the trend intersects with multiple GitHub signals: AI trading bots appearing in trending repos, and DeFi tooling repos (CloddsBot at 50 stars) blurring the line between automated trading and agent frameworks. The structural question is whether Solana's high throughput (1,179 non-vote TPS) and low latency make it the execution layer for autonomous agents.",
