Reduces the 'hello world' for a Solana AI agent from weeks of integration work to a single CLI command. The agent template includes: wallet management, Jupiter swap execution, Jito bundle submission for MEV protection, SIGNIA identity attestation, and a configurable strategy interface. Think 'create-solana-dapp but for AI agents.'",
    "target_user": "AI/ML developers who want to deploy agents on Solana but are blocked by the complexity of Solana program interaction, wallet management, and transaction construction. Pain point: building a Solana-native agent from scratch requires deep Solana knowledge (transaction building, CPI, PDAs) that AI developers don't have. They'd use this because it abstracts Solana complexity behind an agent-friendly API.",

When an AI agent requests a paid API endpoint (data feed, computation, model inference), the server returns HTTP 402 with a Solana payment instruction. The agent's wallet automatically pays (SPL token transfer via Token Program TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA) and retries the request with a payment proof header. Enables the 'machine-payable web' where AI agents can autonomously purchase services without human intervention.",

Secondary: API providers who want to monetize machine-to-machine traffic without API key management.

Inspired by Ethereum's clientdiversity.org but built for Solana's specific dual-client architecture. Alerts when client diversity drops below safety thresholds.",
